# PhonePe Pulse Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves data extraction, transformation, database insertion, and dashboard creation using Python scripting and libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit, and mysql-connector-python.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Extraction

Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using the provided scripts to fetch the data. The extracted data will be stored in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON.

### 2. Data Transformation

Utilize Python, along with Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This step includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

### 3. Database Insertion

Connect to a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

### 4. Dashboard Creation

Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python. Leverage Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display data on a map and use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface with dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures.

### 5. Data Retrieval

Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. This data will be used to dynamically update the dashboard.

### 6. Deployment

Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Thoroughly test the solution and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
